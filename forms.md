blog post, blog post series, journal article, journal special issue, review, book

prompts:
how do you record or make knowledge or new ideas/thoughts in other fields, hobbies?
metaphors for community (e.g. folk garden)?
outcomes that don’t fit well as outcomes, like process documents, reflections, failures, speculative future directions…things that don’t quite fit so well into the mold of “look we produced a thing and this is the result. less result and fuzzier/process-driven/affect-oriented; ephemeral stuff too (like a one-time puppet show)
